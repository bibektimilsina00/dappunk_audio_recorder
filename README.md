# DappPunk Audio Recorder

A Flutter application for recording audio, visualizing waveforms in real-time, and applying audio filters.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses **FVM (Flutter Version Management)** to ensure consistent Flutter versions across environments.

### Prerequisites

- **FVM**: Ensure you have FVM installed.
  ```bash
  dart pub global activate fvm
  ```
- **Flutter SDK**: This project is pinned to Flutter version **3.35.7**.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd dappunk
    ```

2.  **Install Flutter SDK via FVM:**
    ```bash
    fvm install 3.35.7
    fvm use 3.35.7
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    fvm flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **iOS Setup (Mac only):**
    ```bash
    cd ios
    pod install
    cd ..
    ```
    *Note: Ensure you have CocoaPods installed.*

### Running the App

Run the app using FVM:

```bash
fvm flutter run
```

## 🏗 Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI components (Pages, Widgets) and State Management (BLoC).
- **Domain Layer**: Contains Business Logic (Use Cases) and Entities. It is independent of external libraries.
- **Data Layer**: Handles data retrieval and storage (Repositories, Data Sources).

For a detailed explanation of the architecture and design decisions, please refer to [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🧩 Features

- **Audio Recording**: High-quality audio recording with AAC encoding.
- **Real-time Waveform**: Dynamic visualization of audio amplitude during recording.
- **Audio Playback**: Play back recorded audio files.
- **Audio Filters**: Apply fun filters like Chipmunk, Deep Voice, etc. (Powered by FFmpeg).
- **Recordings Management**: List, rename, and delete recordings.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Waveform Visualization**: The waveform is generated by polling the recorder's amplitude every 100ms. While effective, extremely fast transient sounds might be missed between poll intervals.
- **FFmpeg Size**: The app uses `ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new` which significantly increases the app size.
- **iOS Simulator**: Audio recording may not work correctly on the iOS Simulator. It is recommended to test on a physical device.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Background Recording**: Enable recording while the app is in the background.
- **Cloud Sync**: Sync recordings to a cloud storage provider.
- **More Filters**: Add more advanced audio effects (Reverb, Echo, etc.).
- **Trimming/Editing**: Allow users to trim or cut parts of the recording.
- **Share Functionality**: Export and share audio files directly from the app.
